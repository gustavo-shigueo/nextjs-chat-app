This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# NextJS videochat app

This project is a reimaging of my original [WebRTC-videochat](https://github.com/gustavo-shigueo/WebRTC-videochat) webapp implemented with NextJS

My goal is to create a great user experience by creating a much nicer UI and a much more robust backend with NextJS API routes, a MySQL database to store the users and their chats, a messaging system, group calls (the previous app is limited to 2 people per call) and authentication with JWT combined with Google OAuth (may implement more social auth methods when I actually learn how to do this)

I could use some help, feel free to contribute to this project as it will massively help me get it done.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
